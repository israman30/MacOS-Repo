## Overview

NeatOS is a native macOS application built with SwiftUI that helps you organize, clean, and archive files through a conversational interface. Simply type what you want—"clean my desktop," "find duplicates," "archive old files"—and NeatOS suggests and executes smart cleanup actions with full undo support.

---

## App Icon

The source icon lives at `Pepe Assiant/Assets.xcassets/netos-icon.imageset/netos-icon.png` (1024×1024). The macOS app icon (`Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`) requires multiple sizes.

To generate/copy all required sizes into `AppIcon.appiconset`, run:

```bash
bash "Pepe Assiant/Scripts/generate-macos-appicon.sh"
```

Then rebuild in Xcode.

## Features

### 🤖 Conversational Interface

- **Natural language commands** — Type requests in plain English
- **Quick action chips** — One-tap access: Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Find Duplicates, Clear Derived Data
- **Interactive chat bubbles** — Action buttons and real-time feedback
- **Keyword-based intent handling** — Recognizes "clean," "organize," "duplicate," "archive," "derived data," "xcode"

### 📁 Smart File Analysis

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **File Classification** | Categorizes by type: Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Screenshots, Downloads, Unknown |
| **Duplicate Detection** | SHA256 hashing for exact duplicate files |
| **Similar Files** | Vision-based image similarity; base-name grouping for documents |
| **Age Analysis** | Identifies files older than 90 days for archiving |
| **Size Analysis** | Flags files larger than 500MB for compression |
| **Screenshot Detection** | Special handling for screenshot-named files |

### 🪟 Results Browser (Split View)

- **Master–detail layout** — Browse categorized files on the left, inspect details on the right
- **Sorting controls** — Sort by Size, Extension, or Format (ascending/descending)
- **Quick Look preview** — Rich file preview pane (images, PDFs, documents, etc.)
- **Large files review** — Banner + review sheet for \(≥ 500MB\) files

### 🔐 Sandbox-Friendly Folder Access

- **Permission prompts when needed** — Desktop / Downloads / Documents access via user selection
- **Persistent access** — Security-scoped bookmarks stored for future scans

### 🧹 Intelligent Cleanup Actions

- **Move** — Organize files into category folders
- **Archive** — Old files into `~/Archive/YYYY-MM/`
- **Delete** — Duplicates/similar files to Trash (not permanent)
- **Compress** — Large files to `~/Compressed/`
- **Auto-sort Downloads** — Files in Downloads 24+ hours → Documents/Screenshots/Videos/etc.

### 🔧 Xcode Cleaner

- Clears Xcode Derived Data via user-selected folder
- Uses security-scoped access for sandbox compatibility
- Reports freed disk space
- Accessible via menu (⌘⇧D) or quick chip

### 🔄 Undo & Safety

- **Undo stack** for move, archive, delete, compress
- **Preview and confirmation** before running actions
- **Conflict handling** for duplicate filenames
- **Trash-only deletion** — no permanent file removal

### ♿ Accessibility

- Full VoiceOver labels and hints
- Keyboard shortcuts: ⌘1 (Desktop), ⌘2 (Downloads), ⌘3 (Documents), ⌘⇧D (Derived Data), ⌘⇧Z (Undo)

### Technologies

- **SwiftUI** — UI framework
- **AppKit** — NSOpenPanel, NSWorkspace, NSImage
- **CryptoKit** — SHA256 for duplicate detection
- **Vision** — Image similarity
- **QuickLookUI / PDFKit** — File previews in Results
- **Foundation** — FileManager, URL, DateFormatter

### State Management

- `BotAssistantView` owns a single `AppViewModel` instance (`@StateObject`) for the lifetime of the chat UI.
- `AppViewModel` exposes the core “engine” objects (`FileScanner`, `FileOperations`, `XcodeCleaner`, `FolderAccessController`) used across views.
- Long-running work uses `async/await`; UI-facing state (progress/busy flags) is published by the engines for SwiftUI to render.

### Building

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Pepe Assiant/Pepe Assiant.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run (⌘R)
